        <h1><u><i>What is Dosa?</i></u></h1>
        <img src="Dosa.jpg">
        <hr>
        <p>In its most simple form, dosa is crispy 
            
        and crepe-like and is a very popular street
         food in India. Dosa is famous for its simple
          ingredients and savory, slightly bitter 
          flavor. It can be eaten as a snack, breakfast,
           or anytime you’re in the mood for a delicious, savory
            meal! 
            Originating in southern India, the crispy dosa has been around
             since the 5th century AD. It’s said that dosa was first referenced 
             by Chalukya King Somesvara III in Tamil literature in 1054 AD. Like
              many Indian foods, dosa varies depending on region and occasion. </p>

                    <h1><u><i>What to eat it with?</i></u></h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We can eat it with coconut chutney, sambar,
                         idli podi, and onion chutney are the popular 
                         side dishes for idli and dosa, there are many 
                         more regional-specific sides for the popular idli and 
                         dosa.</p>

                         <p>It's customary in Indian culture to eat dosa with your hands. 
                            I like to tear it off and eat it in small bites. If served with 
                            a dip or chutney, you can tear pieces off and dunk them into 
                            the dip or sauce before eating, or you can leave it whole and dip
                             as you go!</p>
